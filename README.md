# ZADANIE3.1
Project 3 part 1

The problem of our project is to make a program that has a complicated if-statment built out of 6 or more conditions that have to be met.

This program is written in C.

What this program does is gets 3 arguments (that should be intergers) and says if it's possible to make a rectangular triangle out of lines of their length.

file: zad3.1.c

To compile: gcc -Wall -O2 -ansi -pedantic -std=c99 -o zad3.1 zad3.1.c -lm

for example ./zad3.1 3 4 5

Other then that there is another program that is the negation of our first program so teoretically it will tell us if out of the three integers we provide it isn't possible to make a rectangular triangle.

file nzad3.1.c

To compile: gcc -Wall -O2 -ansi -pedantic -std=c99 -o nzad3.1 nzad3.1.c -lm
